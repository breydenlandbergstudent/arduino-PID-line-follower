# Macquarie University Robotics Society Arduino PID Line Follower
## Description
This repository contains the code for an Arduino PID line follower project, developed by MURC. The robot which runs this code will be able to follow a traced black line (typically made from black tape or a black marker) set out on a flat surface. The robot utilises IR (infrared) sensors, which responds to reflected IR light. Using the IR light reflected by the black line, the robot can determine its position in relation to the line, and what corrections it needs to make to continue following the line.

The robot moves forward at a hard-coded speed, and adjusts itself specifically in relation to this speed.

The robot is specifically required to:
- Follow straight lines;
- Follow curved lines (limitation?);
- Follow any lines which contain angles <= 90 degrees.
